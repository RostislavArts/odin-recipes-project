        <p>Pasta fazool is a classic Italian-American comfort food. This recipe works with any sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans. A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put together. This recipe makes enough for two large portions or four smaller ones.</p>
