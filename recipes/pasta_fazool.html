        <h2>Pasta Fazool (Pasta e Fagioli)</h2>

        <p>Pasta fazool is a classic Italian-American comfort food.</p>
        <p>This recipe works with any sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans.</p>
        <p>A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put together. This recipe makes enough for two large portions or four smaller ones.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>12 ounces sweet bulk Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 cup dry elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups chopped Swiss chard</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can cannellini (white kidney) beans, drained</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus additional for serving, or to taste</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <p><b>Gather the ingredients.</b></p>
        <p>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook until onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta; cook and stir for 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 3 cups broth; increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add more broth if needed.</p>
        <p>Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer chard to a colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until leaves wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese. Serve topped with additional grated cheese.</p>
